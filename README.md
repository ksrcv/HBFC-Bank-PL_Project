# HBFC-Bank-PL_Project
## Business Problem:
In the last campaign, the bank reached out to 5000 customers out of which 480 customers accepted the personal loan offer. The bank incurred a huge cost in running a marketing campaign to reach out to so many customers. We are tasked to optimise the cost of this campaign by identifying the correct target base (without a significant reduction in number of acceptance of offers). The bank can then send Personal Loan offers to these target customers who have a higher chance of accepting the offer. Based on your analysis, suggest a strategy for the management of HBFC Bank.
