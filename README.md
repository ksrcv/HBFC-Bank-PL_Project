# HBFC BANK Personal Loans Project
## Business Problem:
In the last campaign, the bank reached out to 5000 customers out of which 480 customers accepted the personal loan offer. The bank incurred a huge cost in running a marketing campaign to reach out to so many customers. We are tasked to optimise the cost of this campaign by identifying the correct target base (without a significant reduction in number of acceptance of offers). The bank can then send Personal Loan offers to these target customers who have a higher chance of accepting the offer. Based on your analysis, suggest a strategy for the management of HBFC Bank.

The Dataset, Excel sheet with all the analysis and the Powerpoint which contains all the findings are provided in the repository.

here's is the summary of my findings:

--> Customers who are either Professional or Graduate

--> Customers whose annual income is greater than 100k/Year.(Avoid customers whose annual income is less than 50k/Year.)

--> Customers who do not have a Term Deposit Account

--> Customers who use online Internet banking facilities.

The bank should consider sending Personal Loan offers to customers who meet the above-mentioned criteria
